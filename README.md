## My process

### Built with

- HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I mainly completed this challenge to see if I still remembered HTML & CSS. I took a break from learning for two months and everything was a little fuzzy, but I find it pretty cool that I remembered most of it. My main issue was using flexbox cause that was a pretty new concept to me, but after playing around with it I got it. 

### Continued development

I don't really have much plans for continued development other than making it more mobile friendly. 

### Useful resources

- [Flexbox Zombies](https://mastery.games/flexboxzombies/) - Helped me relearn flexbox! It was actually pretty fun.
